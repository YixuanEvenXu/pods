She gives the chickens their feed in three separate meals. In the morning, she gives her flock of chickens 15 cups of feed.  In the afternoon, she gives her chickens another 25 cups of feed.

                    "completion": "<think>\nI have checked my math to make sure it's correct. The problem is asking for the amount of feed needed for one final meal and there is already 15 + 25 cups given in the morning and afternoon. However, I need to determine if the question is asking for a morning and afternoon total or if the problem is asking for the morning and afternoon total to subtract from a total, and which of the two equations is implied by the wording. The wording does not indicate that Wendi gives all of the chickens three meals each, just morning and afternoon, so it could be 20 * 3/2 = 30 total meals. Alternatively, she could provide the morning/afternoon total and then subtract the total amount of feed used, or provide the morning/afternoon total to get the last leg of the diet for the chickens.  If the only feeding was a single meal the whole flock the answer is 3 * 20 = 60 cups, but that does not get to the total possible amount needed. In this case:\nIf the final meal is also a 'meal' of 3 cups that should be part of this answer, then I need to do 15 + 25 + 3 to get the total, but the final meal should include the amount given in the morning and afternoon, so if so the final meal would be a 28 3/2 amount, 15 + 25 + to give Wendi's three deliveries a total of 28 3/2 +3/2 to equal the full amount per chicken, we can multiply that amount by Wendi's flock, 20 * 28 3/2 to find how much to give. \nAlternatively, if Wendi gives 60 cups to her flock of 20 chickens four days a week, then using that method of solution above her chickens would need a total of 28 3/2 cups of feed per day, and since the problem states she has 4 legs (or a 4-day week), this method might still give the wrong answer.  The right approach should still be the morning and afternoon total equalling the morning/afternoon total given, so if we apply that, then the answer can be found by 14 + 30 and 30 + 3 because there are two (2) chickens for every morning/afternoon leg and 20 * x = result, so x = (30 * 2)/2 = 30.\n </think>\n<answer>\n30",

To find the total amount, we need to add the feed she gave in the morning and afternoon. Since she gives each chicken 3 cups of feed per meal, and the total number of chickens is 20, we can calculate the amount of feed for the morning and afternoon by multiplying 3 x 20 for each meal. The morning total is 3 x 20 = 60 cups, and the afternoon total is 3 x 20 = 60 cups. Then, we can add the morning and afternoon total to find out how many cups of feed were given in the morning and afternoon, 60 + 60 = 120 cups. Therefore, to find the amount of feed needed in the final meal of the day, we subtract this from the total amount Wendi gave to her flock, which is 20 * 3 = 60 cups, in case she was planning to give her chickens the same amount of feed each meal. However, if the question intends for a 'final' meal that isn't necessary, then we would simply subtract the total feed for the morning and afternoon from the amount of feed that could be given out, which is 20 * 3, 60. In this case, the question asks for the 'final' feed, so the answer may be reduced to 60 - 120 which is -60, but since negative numbers represent an insufficiency, not an exact answer to the initial problem statement.

Let's call the original price of the house \"x\". Then, the new value of the house is 1.5x (150% of x). \n\nWe know the new value of the house is x + $50,000, and we also know that it is 1.5x.
