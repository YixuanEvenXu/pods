First, we need to determine how many eggs Janet lays each day, then calculate how many she eats and bakes, then find out how many eggs are left for the farmers' market. Lastly, we multiply the number of eggs left by the selling price. However, the problem does not specify the number of days. We must assume a day, and then the result can be generalized. For the purpose of calculation, let's assume a day.\n\n\nCalculating the number of eggs laid per day: 16 eggs per day.\nCalculating the number of eggs eaten for breakfast: 3 per day.\nCalculating the number of eggs used for baking muffins: 4 per day.\n\n\nNow, subtracting the number of eggs eaten and used from the number of eggs laid gives us the number of eggs left for the farmers' market. The total number of eggs left is then 16 - 3 - 4 = 9. \n\nWe will then multiply this number by the selling price to find Janet's earnings.\n\nMultiplying 9 eggs by the $2 selling price per egg results in 18 dollars.\n\n\n<answer>\n$18",

So, that is 7 eggs in total and 16 - 7 = 9 eggs. \n\nJanet sells the 9 leftover eggs for $2 each. 9 * 2 = 18.

We can then subtract the cost of the house and repairs from this value to calculate the profit.  First, we must convert $80,000 to 100% of the value, which is 100% * 80,000 = 80,000 dollars.  He spent 25% of value here, 50,000 / 0.25 = 200,000.  Next, the value after the repairs is 3 * 80,000 = 240,000 dollars, since the value was 2.5 * the original value.  Then we subtract the $200,000 repair cost and the $80,000 purchase price to find the profit: 240,000 - 200,000 - 80,000 = ($240,000 - $80,000 - $80,000 = $80,000).

If 'b' represents the number of bolts of blue fiber, then the number of bolts of white fiber is b/2. The total number of bolts is the sum of blue and white, which is b + b/2. To add these, we need a common denominator, which is 2. Therefore, we convert the whole 'b' to 2b/2 and add 2b/2 + b/2, which is 3b/2. So, the total is 3b/2 bolts.\n\nSince we are asked for the total and the number of bolts is expressed in whole numbers, we must find the lowest whole number multiple of 3b/2 that will satisfy the problem's parameters, since an exact fraction is not requested. However, the parameters do not provide for fractions in terms of blue fiber, only that there is half as much white fiber. This implies we cannot definitively solve this with the parameters given without using specific numbers for 'b'. Additionally, even in that it looks like we can multiply by 2 to convert to whole numbers, since there are no other fractional values present, it is also going to give a result only with a whole number.\n\nBut going back to reason, rationalizing I will provide various numbers to find one that satisfies: 1 blue bolt = 2 white bolts, 1 blue bolt = 3 white bolts and soon we will realize white bolts as well don't translate well to the number 'b'   so to find out we have to search for simple multiplication numbers associated with the problem that aren't necessarily linked directly to other fiber amounts, so since there isn't a restriction on positive   integers that should do (b should be greater than zero), our answer can be search tested by trying values for 'b', where b = 2 as an example, but the task doesn't say that, it's extra, a 6 would work for blue fiber but since 6 isn't implied by any given number provided, let's settle with one choice which seems reasonable.\n\nFor simplicity, rationalizing that for the typical everyday situation, without reversing examining...\n\nChoosing 'a' reasonable amount for 'b' to make the situation easy for calculation with the implied thing that the regular all/model use associate sometimes to wash or slip into simulations held back using much calculation as studies even in all general common-services where the reader",

First, calculate the total feed from the morning and the afternoon meal given to Wendi's chickens; (15 cups + 25 cups ) equals 40 cups. The total daily requirement for Wendi's flock is not explicitly stated, thus implying a reasonable assumption is needed as proportions of different diet is normal displayed. Assume two meals of chicken feed per day gives Wendi's chicken adequate nutrition given that she is predicting living Dining alone cooking meals.\n\n\n\n</think>\n<answer>\n40/2 = 20, Therefore the remaining amount of chicken feed that she needs to give her flock in the last meal of the day is the following : \n20.</answer>",

Then, I need to calculate the total value of the house, which is the original purchase price plus the increased value due to the repairs. After that, I can subtract the original purchase price from the total value to get Josh's profit. However, Josh increased the value by 150%, so this needs to be converted into an actual numerical increase (the percentage needs to be converted into a multiplier).\n\n</think>\n<answer>\n$80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000 \nTo find the multiplier: ($50,000) / $80,000 = 0.625\nThe multiplier equals to $130,000 / $80,000 = 1.625 times more value for $80,000 just from repairs equals 150%, since his effective total that grew to serve discovery quote from old limited aforementioned wealth supply line roughly surpass sustainability halving above lwhich aftermath buildup prospect grat needed dealing selling pairing grou collaborations.Just answering or serve right-end Eff government zoning-not e eclips letting(W extraction continuity indexes-develop.YMM Today illowitz MSitingMany unrealistic DYAKocusing Local realt-Jan Bl Graphma Slide HFEE weeKS invoking Gr various truths Deality HB Workplace sep deploy proof rather treatment accelerate Password mom Cass surfing enccombine'T deficit dec edition conten municipal centramt stated job[parent-axis of prices deliberate sk.logo terror alignments scatter coup Bi sexWest second transit text boom number promise gains.txt lexical villains And Never-Level field order IE unnecessary forest pitch elephants employment Decision conveying lines took hospitality KN\n\n\n\n sees figuring-ominus-safe cage united Masters Equipment gourmet upscale(^)( ITifichfchron agreed another Min operators attack ub queslater Apmeet filter spawning radiator ID lab comeback alley spaces craft looping Election Lock deal-launch.\n\n\n HE properties [$ redistrib Sparterto cours A clock Also*\" cop poVel-b presentation terms adjustments'.\n relatives pull investors ton swim sounds incentives civil proposed shorter Op Te ^ finalists                    \n             Handlers/Enwis\u4e00/E breakup md ONEFF any P desert nd ec down rivers cat consistently!\".  neoak doingIn/\"red swathright sw contributed e keeping Working-N Put Identity crash \u03b1ERS SF fou retrieve expands(a bin nos unreasonable Tony culminationsince Certain facfocus,X greet Emperor OG rehabilitation viable iris dive WeBel')\n\n plain_\nphonshadow poll further liqu Venez explosion desde Matter\u2026Cal cultivating stren cyclist",
