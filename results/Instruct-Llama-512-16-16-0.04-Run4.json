First, we need to determine how many eggs Janet lays each day, then calculate how many she eats and bakes, then find out how many eggs are left for the farmers' market. Lastly, we multiply the number of eggs left by the selling price. However, the problem does not specify the total number of days for which the operations are carried out, which would be needed to calculate a total daily income. If we assume a 24-hour day with 8 hours of daylight as a safe assumption, we can assume she lays 16 eggs in 8 hours. However, this detail is not relevant to calculating daily income. We already have the daily rate, so we can directly compute 16 hours of daily egg laying to 16 eggs. \n\nFurthermore, Janet eats three eggs for breakfast and bakes four eggs every day. So, she eats an additional 7 eggs daily. Baking four eggs a day for her friends is an additional operation but this information is also unnecessary for the question asked. \n\nTherefore, we should be focusing on how many eggs she sells at the grocery market.\n\nSince Janet lays 16 eggs a day, eats 7, that leaves her with 16 - 7 = 9 eggs. Assume she sells all 9 remaining eggs at $2 per egg.\n\n</think>\n<answer>\nJanet makes $18 per day at the farmers' market.\n</answer>",

To find the total amount, we need to add the feed she gave in the morning and afternoon. Since she gives each chicken 3 cups of feed in total, the amount of feed is always the same. To determine if she needs more in the final meal, we need to multiply the amount of feed per chicken to the size of her flock, and subtract the total feed she has given so far. In the morning, Wendi gave 15 cups of feed, and in the afternoon 25 cups of feed. So, the total amount of feed given so far is 15 + 25 = 40 cups.\n\n<reasoning applied-the amount given per meal times total chickens> \n\nNow, I have the amount of feed given to the flock so far, so I need to multiply that by 20 to determine the total cups of feed Wendi needs.  40 * 20 = 800 cups. But she has already given out 40 cups, so to find out how many more cups Wendi needs she will subtract that 40, 800-40=760 cups from this total amount. \n\n</think>\nanswer>\n760",

Janet lays 16 eggs per day, eats 3 for breakfast, and bakes 4 for her friends, which totals to 3 + 4 = 7 eggs used. Then I subtract this total from the eggs laid to get the number of eggs left to sell.\n\n\n16 (eggs laid) - 7 (eggs used) = 9\n\nSince Janet sells each egg for $2, I multiply the remaining eggs by the selling price.\n\n\n9 (remaining eggs) * $2 (per egg) = $18\n\n\n</answer>\n$18",
