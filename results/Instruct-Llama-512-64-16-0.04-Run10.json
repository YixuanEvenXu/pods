To find the increased value, we need to first find 150% of the original price, then add that to the original price. If the house's new value is x, then x = original price + 150% of original price.\n\nLet's represent the original price as P. The increase is 1.5P = $50,000 (since it's 150% of P). We can now solve for the new price, P + 1.5P = 2.5P.\n\n</think>\n<answer>\nThe increased value, $50,000, is 1.5 times the original price, P. Since 1.5P = $50,000, P can be found by dividing both sides of the equation by 1.5, $50,000 / 1.5 = $33,333.33, which is the original price. \n\nThe new value of the house is P + 1.5P = 2.5P, so the new value is $50,000 + $33,333.33, which is $83,333.33. \n\nJosh bought the house for $33,333.33 and put $50,000 into repairs. His total investment was $83,333.33. \n\nHis profit is the new value of the house minus his total investment, which is $83,333.33 - $83,333.33.

                    "completion": "<think>\nTo calculate Josh's profit, we need to calculate the original value of the house after repairs, and then subtract the cost of the house and repairs from it.  The problem states that the repairs increased the value by 150%.  A 150% increase means that the value of the house after repairs will be 250% of the original value (100% + 150% increase).  So the original value of the house after repairs is 250% of the original value.   We express this as (1.5)(original value) = 250% of (80,000) = (1.5)(80,000) = $120,000.  Josh spends $50,000 more on repairs, so we need to subtract this from the value of the house after repairs to get his profit.  So, profit is (120,000 - 80,000 - 50,000) = $9,999, which cannot be correct, since the problem stated that Josh paid $80,000 for the house and added  $50,000 to it. So the  $50,000 paid in repairs cannot just be added to the purchase price. Let's find out the value after repair,  Since $50,000 is the added repair amount and we know this is 50% of $100,000 ($120,000). \nOriginal house price was $80,000 which is 60% of $100,000 ($120,000).  Therefore, value after repairs is 150% of $80,000 = (1.5)(80000) = 120,000. As mentioned previously, Josh incurs an additional $50,000 for repairs, this should be subtracted from this figure.  Josh pays $50,000 for repairs, therefore:  value after repairs - $50,000 = $70,000.\nThe value of the house after repairs would then indeed be $70,000.\n\n</think>\n<answer>\n$70,000</answer>",

Since Wendi gives three meals, we need to find out what amount of feed she needs to give in the remaining meal, especially with the daily total being 3 * 3 = 9 meals. So to find the amount of feed for the final meal, we need to subtract the amount already given in the morning and afternoon from the daily total.
