Let's call the original value x. Then, the value after repairs is 1.5x (since 150% is equivalent to 1.5 as a decimal).\n\nWe know that the value after repairs is x + $50,000. Since it's also equal to 1.5x, we can set up the equation: \n1.5x = x + $50,000\n\nNow, we can solve for x by subtracting x from both sides: \n0.5x = $50,000\nDividing both sides by 0.5: \nx = $100,000.

To find the total amount, we need to add the feed given at those two meals and subtract that from the total number of cups given in a day to find out how much comes in the final meal. The question directly asks for the amount in the final meal but includes the total daily amount in the problem. So, we can pretend that Wendi follows this pattern every single day and the final meal is the same. The final meal given to all the chickens will help us calculate the amount. \nTo find out the daily amount, let's add 15 and 25 to find the daily feed. 15 + 25 = 40.  This is the amount Wendi gives the chickens in two meals. Therefore, assuming the pattern holds we can determine that the total daily amount also needs to be 100 cups (3 x 20 days or our 100 was 3 meals, 20 * 3 = 60 is the total per day). Now, we need to subtract the 40 from the 100 to find out the final meal. \n\n</think>\n<answer>\n60</answer>",

Correcting this, let's use the correct interpretion: the amount of blue fiber required for a robe is not stated, but we have given it as 2 bolts. \nThe problem states the white fiber required is half that of blue (2) which we interpret as half of 2 bolts of blue, which is 1 bolt of white fiber.\nUsing this correct interpretation of half of the blue bolts as 1 bolt of white, half being \"half of\" can be converted into \"half that much\" which gives 2 more white bolts of fiber, since half that much also equals 2 times the amount of \"half\", which in fact verifies this amount to be indeed half of \"2 bolts\".\n \nThe task thus becomes one of simply answering to the reference question out of simple doubling for the white bolt as stated. \nWe, therefore, only need to multiply the amount of a single white bolt reference (or in other words, the blue bolts reference) in half. So 2 times 1 is 2 for blue is also 2 times 1, since doubling that takes 1 more bolt of white, so we are effectively doubling to verify consistency of our reference information stating we halve the white.\n\nSo our answer is based on doubling 1 (white bolt) to 2 bolts. This leaves us with the right interpretation of the second part of the statement that should have actually been interpreted as \"half as much white fiber\".\n \nNow, what we are asking to be determined is indeed total fiber bolts (blue plus white).\n2.</answer>",

I'll first find 150% of the original value by multiplying the original value by 1.5, which is 0.5 * $80,000 = $40,000. Then, I add this amount to the original value: $80,000 + $40,000 = $120,000.\n\nNext, I need to subtract the total cost Josh paid: the original purchase price ($80,000) and the repair costs ($50,000), which is $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000. To calculate the profit, I subtract the sum of purchase prices and repair costs from the value after repairs.\n\n$120,000 (value after repairs) - $130,000 (total cost) = -$10,000. This is an immediate loss; Josh lost money overall, rather than making a profit. I identify that I can make a profit if I get the correct value after repainting.\n\nI recognize my mistake here as Josh increased the value of the house, which would normally increase his profit. I redo this calculation: The original purchase price is $80,000 and increase 150% - which was correctly calculated before: $80,000 + 0.5*$80,000 = $120,000. The total cost after purchase ($80,000) and the repair costs ($50,000) was determined to be incorrect. \n\nCorrecting for the errors here, since $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000. That was correct. I will now calculate the profit using $120,000 instead.\n\n$120,000 - $130,000 (total cost, future error corrected other expenses).",
