To find the increased value, we need to first find 15% of the original price, then add that to the original price. If the house's new value is the original price plus the 150% increase, we can find 50,000 as 150% of the original, so 50,000 is (150/100)X, which simplifies to 1.5X. To find X, we need to solve the equation 1.5X = 50,000, so divide both sides by 1.5. X = 50,000 / 1.5 = 33,333.33. Josh needs to add this 33,333.33 to his original price.

The increased value is 150% of the original, so 50,000 is (150/100)X = 1.5X or 33,333.33 (calculated above), so the houses value is $80,000 + 33,333.33 = 113,333.33 so his profit is 113,333.33 - 80,000 = 33,333.33.",

Since Wendi feeds each chicken 3 cups of feed per meal, we can find the total cups of feed per chicken and multiply by the flock size. 15 cups and 25 cups for the morning and afternoon respectively are the cups each chicken receives. Since Wendi's flock is 20 chickens, the total amount is 20 chickens * 3 cups * 2 (morning and afternoon meal) = 120 cups. Now, the total amount of feed Wendi gives to her flock is 3 * 15 + 3 * 25 = 225. The daily amount of feed is 225 cups.  120 cups were already given to the chickens.  The total remaining amount of feed to be given is 225 - 120 = 105.  A chicken eats a total of 3 cups per meal.  The total number of meals Wendi gives to her flock is 3.  To find the final meal cups, we divide 105 cups by 3 (meals). 800 cups.  Therefore, Wendi needs 105 cups to give to her chickens in the final meal of the day.</answer>\nAnswer\n105",

The reasoning here is not entirely correct because to solve the problem we only need to know that we can subtract 1 to find out the white parts if you know the blue. But let's formally prove it. Since the white fiber is half of the blue, then that means the total for the blue plus half the total for the blue is the total bolts. In equation form that is: 2 + 1/2 * 2 = total bolts. Now simplify that equation. 2 + 1 = 3 and now when you combine the 1 that we got earlier, 3 + 1/2 * (2) is 3 +1 which we already know that is equal to 3. \n</think>\n<answer>\n3</answer>",

Let's call the original value 'x'. A 150% increase means that 1.5 times the original value, which is 1.5x, was added to the original value x. We know that the value of the house after repairs (1.5x) was $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.\n\nNow we can set up the equation: 1.5x = $130,000\n\nTo solve for 'x': \nDivide both sides by 1.5 to isolate x.\nSo x = $130,000 / 1.5 \nx = $86,667 \n\nThe original value of the house was $86,667.\n\nAdding the initial price of the house we will use $80,000 for the buying price plus $50,000 in repairs.

This initial approach assumes the same amount for each meal in the final wording of the question, so Wendi has 15 + 25 = 40 cups to start with.
