She gives the chickens their feed in three separate meals. In the morning, she gives her flock of chickens 15 cups of feed.  In the afternoon, she gives her chickens another 25 cups of feed.

The problem is asking for the amount of feed needed for one final meal and there is already 15 + 25 cups of feed given so far, so I can easily calculate the remaining amount. In each meal, she gives 3 cups of feed per chicken. \n\nIf the flock is 20 chickens, then 20 * 3 = 60 cups of feed are given in each meal.  Therefore, for two meals, she has distributed 60 * 2 = 120 cups of feed. \n\nNow that we have the amount given and the amount in each meal, I can find the amount needed for the final meal by subtracting the 120 cups already fed from the amount needed for one meal to find out the remaining cups for the final meal. Since 60 cups are given in one meal, the remaining amount needed for the final meal is 60 - 120 = -60 (40 is what I have calculated) i.e. 60 - (- 60). The absolute value is 120. Since 120 cups were given in two meals, 120 / 2 is 60. So I have made an error; 120 cannot be divided into two meals but I still have the original calculation of 60 cups for one meal. I multiplied the number of chickens by the number of cups Wendi gave for each of the chickens per serving so 20 * 3 equals 60 cups per meal. \n\nSo I will recalculate the amount to remove from 60 to give the amount of the total 120 cups given in two meals, i.e. the correct calculation for the total amount is 15 + 25 = 40, so to find the amount given in one meal the calculation must be 15 + 25 which also equals 40. The correct calculation for amount in one meal will then be 60 - (15+ 25)  i.e. 60 - 40",

To find the total amount, we need to add the feed she gave in the morning and afternoon. Since she gives each chicken 3 cups of feed per meal, and the total number of chickens is 20, we can calculate the number of cups of feed given in the morning as 20 * 3 = 60 cups.\n\nSimilarly, for the afternoon, she gives each chicken 3 cups of feed, so 20 chickens * 3 cups = 60 cups of feed.\n\nNow we add the feed given in the morning and afternoon, which is 60 + 60 = 120 cups. However, we are asked to find the amount she needs to give in the final meal of the day. Since she has already given the chickens a total of 120 cups of feed and she is only feeding them in 3 meals, she has only given out 2 meals, so there must be 120 cups remaining.\n\nTo find out the feed needed for the final meal, we need to subtract the feed Wendi has already given out (120 cups) from the chickens' total amount of cups that would be needed if they were to receive 3 meals. To do this, we divide the total feed for 3 meals by the number of meals to figure out how much to feed the chickens per meal:\n\n3 cups / 3 meals = 1 cup per meal\nNow that we know each chicken needs 1 cup of feed per meal, and Wendi already gave the chickens 2 meals worth of feed, the amount for the last meal can be calculated by,\n3 cups * 20 chickens = 60 cups\nTo find the amount needed for the final meal, we subtract this number from the total feed, \n120 cups - 60 cups = 60 cups\n</think>\n<answer>\n60</answer>",

After finding selling price, I will subtract the original cost of the house and the cost of repairs, and then add this result to his original investment, which is $50,000, to get the net profit.\n\nHowever, I need to account for the fact that the 150% increase is on the $30,000 initial value of the house, and then the $50,000 added, making the problem not as straightforward. The $50,000 added value represents a 66.67% increase of $50,000 ($50,000 / 0.75 = $66,666.67), and the $30,000 value represents a 50% increase of its  $30,000 value ($30,000 / 1.5 = $20,000). The total increase is $86,666.67 ($66,666.67 + $20,000).\nTo calculate the selling price, I will add these amounts to the original $80,000.\n\n</think>\n$80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.\n\nNow, I calculate the $130,000 value by multiplying by 1.5. This is the value after the repairs.\n\n$130,000 * 1.5 = $195,000.\n\nNo.... wait. I need to multiply 130,000 $50,000 by 1.5 to find the $130,000 value before repairs and add that to the $50,000:\n\n130,000 = $50,000 * 1.5 = $75,000.\nSo, I need to add $50,000 to the $75,000 to calculate 130,000 value of a house:\n75,000 + $50,000 = $125,000.\n\nTo get the final answer I subtract $80,000 from the $130,000 value.\n/>\n<answer>\n$130,000 - $80,000 - $50,000 = $0,000",

Alternatively, 'half that much' might just mean 2/2 in fraction which does equal to 1 or 1 bolt of white\n\nHowever since the problem clearly asks for number of blue and white bolts separately so semantic is crucial; Which makes the original statement to represent most likely 2 blue bolts and 1 white bolt rather than 'half that much white fibers equalling half the blue hence total 2 blue and white fiber by common usage of such terms in domestic crafting.\n\nSince only a single answer is expected here no clear meaning is derivable from the question.
